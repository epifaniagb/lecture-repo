Create repository on Github, and click 'Code' button. Copy the SSH link so you do not have to give your Github login credentials to clone. Use cloning command 'git clone {copied SSH link}'. Make sure to cd into the repository from your working directory. Edit code as desired in VS Code and remember to commit and push when you're done
